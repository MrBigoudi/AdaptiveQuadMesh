# HOWTO

## Build

To bild the project, just use:
```sh
make main
./main.app
```

## Usage

Once the window is shown, you can load a mesh (samples are given in `media/objects`), see its fitmaps or move it arround.
You can also save it at any time.

However, if you want to do diagonal collapses, be sure to make the mesh a quad beforehead, otherwise the application will stop !
